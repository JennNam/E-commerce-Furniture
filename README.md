A **MERN stack e-commerce web app** built as a practice project.  

### **Backend**  
- Developed using **Express.js** to build the API server, deployed on **AWS EC2**.  
- Implements **RESTful APIs** to support CRUD operations for users, products, orders, and featured products.  
- Integrated **Google OAuth** authentication alongside a custom login system.  
- **Exception handling**: Secure access control (e.g., users cannot access the "My Orders" page directly via URL; token validation is enforced, and unauthorized users are redirected to the login page).  
- Utilises **MongoDB** as the database.  

### **Frontend**  
- Built with **React.js** to create an interactive and responsive UI.  
- The design is inspired by https://dribbble.com/shots/21218249-Homey-eCommerce-Furniture-Landing-page
